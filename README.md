## Keyboard Pilot Configurator

In order for [Keyboard Pilot](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/keyboard-pilot/id402670023?l=en-GB&mt=12) to work more reliably with CJK input methods, you need to enable the alternative
method in Keyboard Pilot's settings, and use [Keyboard Pilot Configurator](Keyboard%20Pilot%20Configurator%20/Releases/1.0/Keyboard%20Pilot%20Configurator.zip).
